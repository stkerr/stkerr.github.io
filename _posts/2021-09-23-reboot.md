This is the first post with a new [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) approach!

The previous version of the site got hit by some malware related to a Wordpress
plugin. I've had a number of issues with Wordpress over the years and I really
only use it for posting static content periodicially, so likely don't need
a lot of the power it provides.

I will miss a few things like comments and stats on how many hits my different
pages get, but perhaps I can figure a way out on how to do that with static
pages as well. We'll see I suppose.
